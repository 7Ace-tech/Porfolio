            <p class="about">So one project I am currently working on is making a review game for my chemistry class.
                The game will be focusing on one topic of chemistry that I've found needed more review. I am striving
                 for the game to be a multiple choice kind of game but maybe keeping it simple by having it on a 
                 website or maybe with some help of Mr.Baez I could get some help in order to make the game work or
                  improve it. But at the moment it's a work in progress
