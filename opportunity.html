            <p class="about"> The work opportunity I would like to have is either being a Software Engineer
                or being a computer programmer both of these careers sound very interesting since I get to
             work with computers and get to work with other people to make a project that can be beneficial to others 
             and also since we are advancing in the area of technology I feel the call for more programmers would
             be needed so certain machines or programmes could work properly.
             It's not only that we are moving forward in technology that i want to do these jobs it's more that 
            I find programming and creating something that people will use and hopefully help them out is what 
                is fueling me to continue in the area of computer science and hopefully I can help out others to also
                want to continue in the area of computer science since its very interesting and cool since it does open ones
                mind on how the internet works.(well to a certain extent)</p>
